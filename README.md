# Summary of RTOS Options for Raspberry Pi
Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) are designed for applications where precise timing and deterministic task scheduling are critical. While Raspberry Pi single-board computers (SBCs) typically run full-scale operating systems like Linux, they can also operate with an RTOS for time-sensitive projects.

Below is a summary of some RTOS options available for Raspberry Pi: <br>

[Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) make up a family of single-board computers (SBCs) by the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). Initially developed as an educational tool, they've gone on to be used in all manner of projects, including robotics, home automation, IoT, personal and commercial uses. These credit card-sized computers are capable of tasks performed by a regular PC, such as word processing, programming, and web browsing.

On a personal desktop computer, you're likely using a full-scale operating system like [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/windows), [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/), or [Linux](https://www.linux.org/). (Some Raspberry Pis are capable of running Windows, but their native OS is based on Linux.) But sometimes, these types of operating systems are too resource-intensive for your task. For certain projects, a real-time operating system ([RTOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system)) is a more suitable choice.

## RTOS on Pi

Just as the name suggests, an RTOS is meant for time-critical use cases, or in other words, projects with a timing requirement that must be met. Some examples can be seen in spacecraft systems, heart pacemakers, and air traffic control. In contrast to a general-purpose computing system, real-world uses like these require precise time constraints to manage and prioritize tasks.

It must be noted that it's more standard to use a microcontroller board like an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) for real-time tasks. That said, Raspberry Pi SBCs are inexpensive, have a huge community, and offer ample educational resources to get you started. The Raspberry Pi Foundation has also released the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/), their first microcontroller board.

### Limitations

If you do intend to run an RTOS on a Raspberry Pi SBC, some limitations need to be made note of. An important requirement for an RTOS system is sufficient random-access memory (RAM), which older Raspberry Pi models may not have. Depending on your specific use, you'll also need to pay attention to your board's maximum clock speed (the [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) can reach up to 1,500 MHz, but this is not true across the range).

Additionally, Raspberry Pi SBCs lack a real-time clock ([RTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_clock)), and instead keep time via an internet connection. This could mean less reliability and accuracy for time-critical feedback applications. However, there are workarounds for this issue, such as adding a real-time clock module. In fact, the Raspberry Pi Pico is already equipped with RTC hardware.

> **Note:** The "real-time" in RTC is not the same as the "real-time" in RTOS. The former refers to a device capable of telling time in the real world, whereas the latter refers to non-interrupted timing in electronics.

If you have a project in mind that needs an RTOS, there's a wide variety to choose from. Let's look at some of the best RTOS options for Raspberry Pi!

## Raspberry Pi Real-Time OS (RTOS)

### FreeRTOS

*FreeRTOS is a well-documented option with strong community support (Source: [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/))*

[FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/), as you can probably guess from the name, is a free, open-source RTOS for embedded systems. It's a relatively small application composed of just under 9,000 lines of code, including comments! Despite its small size, it's capable of prioritizing, scheduling, and running user-defined tasks. About 40% of its code deals with communication between tasks, so it's a strong option for projects with competing priorities.

FreeRTOS is actively being developed and supported and is even available for use in commercial applications. This means users can bring their product to market using FreeRTOS without permission or even payment to the developers.

[GitHub user jameswalmsley](https://github.com/jameswalmsley) has put together a [basic port of FreeRTOS to Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/jameswalmsley/RaspberryPi-FreeRTOS), which would be a good starting point if you want to try it out for yourself.

- **Developer**: Richard Barry (now managed by [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/freertos/))
- **Intended purpose**: A single, independent solution for time-critical embedded system applications; a smaller and easier-to-use option

# Use Cases for RTOS on Raspberry Pi

Implementing an RTOS on a Raspberry Pi opens up possibilities for applications where timing and reliability are crucial:

- Robotics: Precise motor control and sensor data processing require real-time responsiveness.
- Industrial Automation: Managing machinery and processes with strict timing constraints.
- Medical Devices: Equipment like pacemakers or monitoring systems where delays are unacceptable.
- Aerospace Systems: Satellite controls and avionics that demand high dependability.
- Automotive Applications: Engine management systems, anti-lock braking systems (ABS), and other safety-critical functions.
- IoT Devices: Real-time data acquisition and processing for smart devices and sensors.
- Home Automation: Systems requiring immediate response to inputs, such as security alarms and climate control.
- Telecommunications: Network devices that need to handle data packets with minimal latency.
- Research and Education: Teaching real-time systems concepts or experimenting with time-sensitive algorithms.
- Multimedia Processing: Audio and video applications where synchronization is vital.

By choosing the appropriate RTOS, developers can tailor the Raspberry Pi to meet the stringent timing and reliability requirements of these applications, leveraging its hardware capabilities in a real-time context.
